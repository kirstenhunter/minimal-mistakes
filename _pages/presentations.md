### <a name="polyglot"></a>Becoming a Polyglot

Many people understand the very basics of several languages, all the way to Hello World. However, this isn’t a full fledged application and it’s challenging to make the translations in your head between all the different dialects (interpreted languages aren’t really different from each other like different languages – they work very much the same and the only difference is in the structure of the language). Out in our community are many people who firmly believe that moving from Ruby to Perl is not possible, that it’s very difficult to learn a new language, that it makes no sense to try to understand what “foreign” code might be doing.

In this talk I will cover the example in 5 different languages (Perl, Ruby, PHP, Python, Node) and show how to map the exact same functionality to different languages.

The code can be found on Github at http://www.github.com/synedra/polyglot

### <a name="git"></a>Git as a Datastore

When consuming APIs or working with complex data in SCM systems or databases, frequently you want to grab the metadata and perform diff, grep, and other file-type comparisons on the data you’ve stored. Akamai’s API has a great way to access and update property metadata (management information for websites), but the API is designed mostly for configuration changes. Our customers asked if they could consume the information in a more user-friendly way, so I created a datastore using Git and several Git wrapper tools to allow them to explore the data in a way that was meaningful for them. There are many applications for this sort of solution – I’ll walk through my code example, and describe other use cases which can help your users work with the data in a quick and user friendly manner.

Demonstrated uses:

  * Git-backed Wiki
  * Family Tree
  * Complicated Data tree
