<span style="color: #000000;">Kirsten Hunter is an unapologetic hacker and passionate advocate for the development community. Her technical interests range from graph databases to cloud services, and her experience supporting and evangelizing </span><span class="caps" style="color: #000000;">REST</span><span style="color: #000000;"> APIs has given her a unique perspective on developer success. In her copious free time she’s a gamer, fantasy reader, and all around rabble-rouser. Code samples, recipes, and philosophical musings can be found here.</span>

Other than this blog, you can peruse my [LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/synedra) (I&#8217;m an API Evangelist for Akamai), you can read the story I wrote about [becoming involved in the open source community](http://oreilly.com/pub/a/womenintech/2007/09/20/lowering-the-veil.html), the (somewhat hilarious) tale of [my first technical presentation](https://www.socialtext.net/open/kirsten_2007_06_27), [the paper for my silly web patent](http://www.ra.ethz.ch/CDstore/www5/www303/overview.htm) (from 1996 &#8211; check out the awesome Yahoo! screenshot&#8217;s from SGI&#8217;s Mozilla browser). You can find [pictures](http://www.flickr.com/search/?w=all&q=synedra+-algae+-pond+-diatomeas+-diatom&m=text) people have taken about me on Flickr.
